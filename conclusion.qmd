# Conclusion

Across California counties, asthma burden (measured through prevalence, emergency department visits, and hospitalizations) varies geographically but shows only weak associations with PM2.5 pollution when examined at the county-year level. Although some high-prevalence counties are located in areas that experience more wildfire smoke, neither ED visits nor hospitalizations in 2020 differ meaningfully between counties affected by major fires and those that were not. All of the visual and statistical comparisons consistently show correlations that are close to zero. This indicates that annual PM2.5 counts do not explain county-level patterns in asthma morbidity.

At the same time, long-term PM2.5 trends show a clear increase in particulate exposure across the state, with sharp peaks during major wildfire seasons such as 2018, 2020, and 2021. The disconnect between higher pollution levels and relatively stable asthma outcomes likely reflects both methodological limitations, such as the use of county-level averages and annual pollution summaries, and contextual factors such as reduced healthcare use during the pandemic, widespread masking, and increased time spent indoors. Taken together, these results highlight the complexity of linking pollution and asthma outcomes with aggregated geographic data. They also point to the need for finer-scale exposure measures and more detailed subgroup analyses to better understand how wildfire smoke and particulate matter influence asthma risk in California.
