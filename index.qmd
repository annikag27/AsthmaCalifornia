# Introduction

## Background

Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease that is often triggered or worsened by air pollution. In California, exposure to fine particulate matter (**PM2.5**) and wildfire smoke is a major concern, especially as the state experiences increasingly severe fire seasons and persistent traffic-related pollution. Despite this, asthma burden varies widely across counties, reflecting differences in environmental exposure, population demographics, and healthcare access.

This project combines two primary data sources:

- **Asthma emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and mortality** from the California Department of Public Health (California Breathing).
- **Air quality data** from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which includes annual counts of days when **PM2.5 exceeded federal standards** from 2000–2023.

By merging these datasets, I explored how/if pollution levels relate to asthma outcomes across California counties.
